# Steps:

1. `bun i`
2. `bun ver:bun` for Bun's currently broken version.
3. Visit `localhost:3000`, observe no black WebGL canvas and the error in the console.
4. `bun ver:esbuild` for esbuilds working version.
5. Same URL as (3) except there _is_ a black WebGL canvas and no errors in the console.

## X-Bun Overhead

Thanks for the awesome tool (no sarcasm), Bun's great.
